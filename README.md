 “Wordle” is a game where the player tries to guess a secret word based on the hints that will be provided to the player in Wordle. In Wordle, users have to guess the word that has five letters over six attempts by using a color-hinting strategy and Hint label provided to show the first letter of the secret word which will only display if you hover cursor on the label or you can choose to play game based on color hinting. 
 
 
 Once the player guesses the word, the input letters will be reflected as yellow,gray or green tiles. For example, a green tile means that the player predicted the correct letter and placement of a letter of the final word. A yellow tile means that the letter is present in the final word, but the letter is in the wrong position. The gray tile means a letter does not exist in the correct word. 
 

 If the user fails to guess the correct word, the secret word will be displayed after the 6th attempt and then you can click to play the next word and start the game with a fresh new word.
